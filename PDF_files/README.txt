Depending on your enviornment, you might have to modify the location of the PDF_files folder to be accessible to the CAS server.

Once the file is available to the CAS server you must create a caslib to the location to this folder.

The demonstration places the PDF_files folder as a subdirectory in the Casuser caslib.
